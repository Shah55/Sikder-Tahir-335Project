Our code is divided into the following folders, but we also have our code in AllCodeInOne.scm. 
The AllCodeInOne.scm is in case the loads don't work by some chance, but they should be working.

- Basic_Data_Types
  - adjacencyList.scm
  - adjacencyMatrix.scm
  - graph.scm
  - queue_as_two_stacks.scm
  - set.scm
  - stack.scm

- Graph_Algorithms
  - BreadthFirstSearch.scm
  - DepthFirstSearch.scm
  - Dijkstra's.scm

- Graph_Computations
  - bfs.scm
  - dfs.scm
  - dijkstra.scm

- Basic Data Types Docs
  - adj-list-doc.scm
  - graph-doc.scm
  - queue-doc.scm
  - set-doc.scm
  - adj-matrix.scm
 
- Graph Algorithms Docs
  - bfs-doc.scm
  - dfs-doc.scm
  - dijkstra-doc.scm

The function calls for the algorithms are in the computations folder, with the load files prepared with the appropriate paths.

The function calls for the data types are in the data types folder along with the code if you choose to run it.

Additionally, we have the extra credit portion of this assignment in attempt_at_extracredit.scm.
